# NASA NU-WRF Implementation Branch

This branch is for the implementation of sprayHFs into the NASA NU-WRF model.  The spray code is implemented into the MYNN surface layer module.

Changes relative to `main` are minimial (changing module and file names).  This branch is planned to follow `main` for future development.
